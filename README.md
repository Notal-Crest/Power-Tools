Welcome to Notal Crest.
This application is a PHP based application running on PHP v8.0, and as such you will need a local server to run or work on the application.
If you havent done so, pls download xampp from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html and install it, after installation follow this few steps.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Open Your C Drive and locate the xampp folder.
# 2. clone this application inside the htdocs folder located in the xammp folder.
# 3. Run the xampp control panel and click on the start button in front of apache and mysql(the buttons should change from start to stop, tis means thet the server is strated and you are ready to run your application on a browser.).
# 4. open your brower and type localhost/Power-Tools.
Voila!!!!! your application is served on the browser... now you can edit whater and see the change reflected on the browser before pushin it to github for deployment.
